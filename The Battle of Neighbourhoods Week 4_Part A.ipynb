    "Chennai formerly known as Madras, is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, it is one of the largest cultural, economic and educational centres of south India. According to the 2011 Indian census, it is the sixth-most populous city and fourth-most populous urban agglomeration in India.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first thing that comes to our mind while talking about Chennai cuisine is the early morning special ‘Filter Coffee’ and the all-time favourite ‘Thayir Sadam’ (curd rice). Other than that, the city has a variety of cuisine to offer food lovers – from the typical Idly-Sambhar to the spicy Chettinad dishes. While the authentic multi-cuisine restaurants are famous for their specific delicacies, carts selling steaming hot Idly-Chutney-Sambhar to office goers, small stalls selling Poli and Mini-Samosa at street corners and the Sundal, Bajji and Chat stalls at the beaches still remain the people’s choice."
